# <Prework Study Guide Website>

## Description

This is a website made during the prework portion of the coding bootcamp. The motivation was to have easily accessibly notes of all topics covered. This solves the problem of having information readily available for studying. I learned CSS, JS, Github, HTML.



## Installation

Nothing required for installation, viewable on the web 

## Usage

in the console, you can view the list of topics covered, and upon opening it will randomly assign you a topic to study. Other than that, it is a one page website that can be read from top to bottom.
## Credits

Help was provided by UNC Coding Bootcamp and site was assembled by Peter Kostin
